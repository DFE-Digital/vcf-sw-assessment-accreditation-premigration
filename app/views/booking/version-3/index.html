      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The assessment</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The social worker assessment has two parts to it:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>knowledge assessment</li>
        <li>simulated practice assessment</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will take both parts of the assessment online.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Youâ€™ll take the knowledge assessment before you take the simulated scenario assessment.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="assessmentsExplanation">Knowledge assessment</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">The knowledge assessment is a multiple-choice assessment.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will have 1 hour 30 minutes to answer 60 multiple-choice questions.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The assessment includes short general knowledge questions based on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/knowledge-and-skills-statements-for-child-and-family-social-work" target="_blank">practitioner PQS</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Simulated practice assessment</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Two simulated practice scenarios (like a role play) each 15 minutes long.</p>

        <li>social worker</li>
        <li>other professional</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You will then complete two further assessments based on your simulated practice scenario:</p>
